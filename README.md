SolidOS for android and iOS that is in progress


This is a tutorial on how to run SolidOS for iOS or Android. There has not been a Pine port just yet.

This will aim to be a native support application with cross compatibility

Regardless of fresh installs on Windows 11 without setting any environment variables, you may get pesky gradle build errors in VSCode.

assembleDebug being the worst of them. Literally none of the tutorials worked on this, so I just moved my building habits directly from VSCode to Android Studio.

Initially used Git for Windows which has bash functionality and scripts that emulate Linux commands. *Personal choice of my own. The less libraries and extensions, then simplier the execution of the project and that is my goal here.

For now, I am using Powershell in Windows 11 to run Android Studio.
